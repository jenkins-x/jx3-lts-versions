# jx3-lts-versions

LTS version stream for use with Jenkins X v3.

The LTS version stream releases on a slower cadence than the latest [version stream](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jxr-versions/) which gives users that prefer more confidence over new features better way to understand features and incoming changes.


The LTS version stream will contain a high level change log and links to relevent documentation for noteworthy changes.

Users who prefer to track the latest version stream can continue to, this is what the Jenkins X own infrastructure will use.
